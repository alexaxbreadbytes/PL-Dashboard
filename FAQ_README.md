### Q: Do these results include trading fees?

If you are using the historical data from our bots, trading fees at .075% are included in the results.
If you are uploading your own data, fee inclusion will depend on your exchange. We assume all uploaded trade logs include fees in the reported P/L data and do not account for any extra in our calculations. 

### Q: I have Cinnamon Toast and Short Bread, can I see the results for each bot using this dashboard? 
    
You may choose "Other" under the trading bot choice and select "ETH" as your currency. This will show the overall results of your "ETH" trades, but they will not be isolated to a particular bot. Comparing mutliple bots on the same coin is not supported at this time. To get details on single bot performance, please upload trade logs for each bot separately.

### Q: Where is Kucoin? 
Currently, this dashboard does not support trading logs from Kucoin. At this time, we cannot verify profit/loss from trade logs provided by Kucoin as some necessary data is missing. We will update this dashboard if/when that data is made available in their exported trading logs. 

### Q: What about leverage?
The dashboard is currently set to 1x leverage. We are working on providing an accurate way to reflect users varied leverage choices across trades. 

### Q: The dashboard isn't working correctly for me.
